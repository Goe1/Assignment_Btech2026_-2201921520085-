"Explanation here..." 
The provided Java class, Solution, implements a shuffle and reset mechanism for an array of integers. Below is the detailed approach for each method:

1. Constructor (Solution(int[] nums))
This constructor initializes an instance of the class with a given integer array nums.
It creates a new array data[] of the same length as nums and copies all elements from nums to data[].
This ensures that the original array is stored and can be used for resetting later.
2. reset() Method
This method returns the original array data[], which holds the initial state of the numbers.
It allows restoring the array to its initial configuration.
3. Random() Method
This method generates a random integer within the range [0, data.length - 1] using Random.nextInt(data.length).
It selects a random index from the array.
4. shuffle() Method
The goal of this method is to return a randomly shuffled version of the data array.
It follows these steps:
Create a new array ans[] of the same length as data[] to store the shuffled elements.
Maintain a boolean array added[] to track whether an element has already been placed in ans[].
Iterate through ans[], and for each position:
Generate a random index using the Random() method.
If the index has not been used before (added[index] == false), mark it as used and place data[index] in ans[].
If the index has already been used, retry by decrementing i (ensuring all positions are filled uniquely).
Return the shuffled ans[].
