This repository contains daily solutions to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) problem statements.

## Repository Structure
Each day's problem is stored in a separate folder. The folder includes:
- ProblemStatement.txt: Describes the problem statement.
- SolutionCode.java: Contains the solution code.
- Explanation.md: Explains the approach and logic behind the solution.

## Approach and Solution
### General Approach:
- Analyze the problem statement.
- Break the problem into smaller components.
- Implement using OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction).

### Example:
- Day 1:
  - Problem: Implement a class for a bank account.
  - Solution: Code available in `Day 1/SolutionCode.java`.
  - Explanation: See `Day 1/Explanation.md` for detailed logic.
